# Read: 01 - Introductory HTML and JavaScript

# 1. Structure: Design and build Websites:
* HTML uses tags or elements (characters that sit inside angled brackets) to give the information they surround special meaning.
* HTML uses elements to describe the structure of pages.
* Tags usually come in pairs. The opening tag denotes the start of a piece of content; the closing tag denotes the end.
* Opening tags can carry attributes, which tell us more about the content of that element.
* Attributes require a name and a value.

# 2. Extra Markup:
* DOCTYPES tell browsers which version of HTML you are using.
* You can add comments to your code between the <!-- and --> markers.
* The id and class attributes allow you to identify particular elements.
* The <div> and <span> elements allow you to group block-level and inline elements together.
* <iframes> cut windows into your web pages through which other pages can be displayed.
* The <meta> tag allows you to supply all kinds of information about your web page.
* Escape characters are used to include special characters in your pages such as <, >, and Â©.

# 3. HTML Layout:
* The new **HTML5** elements indicate the purpose of different parts of a web page and help to describe its structure.
* The new elements provide clearer code (compared with using multiple <div> elements).
* Older browsers that do not understand HTML5 elements need to be told which elements are block-level elements.
* To make HTML5 elements work in Internet Explorer 8 (and older versions of IE), extra JavaScript is needed, which is available free from Google.

# 4. Process and Desgin:
* It's important to understand w XX ho your target audience is, why they would come to your site, what information they want to find and when they are likely to return.
* Site maps allow you to plan the structure of a site.
* Wireframes allow you to organize the information that will need to go on each page.
* Design is about communication. Visual hierarchy helps visitors understand what you are trying to tell them.
* You can differentiate between pieces of information using size, color, and style.
* You can use grouping and similarity to help simplify the information you present.

# JavaScript & Jquery:
* JavaScript can be used in browsers to make websites more interactive, interesting, and user-friendly.
* jQuery makes writing JavaScript a lot easier.
* JavaScript can access and modify content of websites.
* Have Program rules or instructions the browser can follow.
* React to events triggered by the user or browser.

## The ABC in Programming:

### A: What is a script and how do I create one?
* A script is a series of instructions that a computer can follow to achieve a goal, like recipes, handbooks, and manuals.
* To write a script, you need to first state your goal and then list the tasks that need to be completed in order to achieve it.
 Start with the big picture of what you want to achieve, and break that down into smaller steps.
* Consider how you might approach a different type of script.
* Often scripts will need to perform different tasks in different situations. You can use flowcharts to work out how the tasks fit together.
* The flowcharts show the paths between each step.

### B: How do computers fit in with the world around them?
* Computers create models of the world using data.
* Models use objects, objects can have properties, methods, and events.

### C: How do I write a script for a web page?

## Writing a script for a **web page**:
1. Three parts come together:
JaveScript language completes the work of HTML and CSS and the result is a very interactive and beautiful page

2. Progressive Enhancement:
These three layers form the basis of a popular approach to building web pages called *progressive enhancement*.

| HTML                     | HTML+CSS                                         | HTML+CSS+JS                       |
|--------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------|
| Building main structures | Adding more colors and rules to give a good look | Making your page more interactive |

3. Creating a basic Javascript:
JavaScript is written in plain text, just like HTML and CSS, so you do not need any new tools to write a script.
4. Linking JS with HTML:
* The HTML <script> element is used to load the JavaScript file into the page. 
* It has an attribute called src, whose value is the path to the script you created.
* This tells the browser to find and load the script file
4. Objects and Methods:
